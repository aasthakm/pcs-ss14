In order to support different libraries, Dissent uses a compile-time wrapper
system that works three layers: user interface, implementation interface, and
the library. Code within src/Crypto implements the user interface and defines
the implementation interface. Implementation interfaces are located within the
appropriate subdirectory, for example, CryptoPP lies in src/Crypto/CryptoPP.
The user interface transparently delegates responsibility to the implementation
interface by specifying the constructor declarations in their appropriate
header files but defines them within the implementation. For example,
src/Crypto/DsaPublicKey.hpp lists three constructors, while the definitions are
written in the src/Crypto/CryptoPP/DsaPublicKeyImpl.cpp.
