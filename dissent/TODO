Code
- Move XOR into Utils
- Generalize crypto code to support EC DSA and Big Integer DSA

Denial of Service
- Reimplement TcpEL using another network library to get around Qt file
  descriptor bug
- Move PeerId agreement into a secure location to prevent DoS

Performance
- Tunnels need fairness / queuing strategy

Security
- Make OAEP module and use it within CSBulk
- Tunnels should perform security handshake to prevent session hijacking
- Implement TlsEL
- Move from public keys to certificates

Usability
- Serialize rounds so that clients can leave, re-join, and re-start without
  waiting for the start of a new round
- Allow Rpcs to timeout
- Implement UdpEL
- Index page with list of all URLs
- Web server supports HTTPS
- Tunnel support for SOCKS4a
- Tunnel FinishPacket should have a "reason" field
