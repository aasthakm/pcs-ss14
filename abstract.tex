Dissent is an anonymous messaging protocol that provides anonymity and accountability with practical overheads for moderate sized (~30-40) groups of users. However, the protocol runtime increases significantly beyond small group sizes, making it unusable for large anonymous groups. In Heresy, we explore a hierarchical arrangement of the anonymous clients and servers into multiple dissent groups. We analyze the asymptotic costs of the Dissent protocol, when applied in hierarchical settings. We also do a brief security analysis of the hierarchical setup.
